# Custom keymap for Sofle Keyboard

## CAUTION
Much WIP!
Differs from sofle/rev1 default keymap!

## Features
- The OLED on master half shows selected mode and caps lock state and is rotated.
- Left encoder controls volume up/down/mute. Right encoder PGUP/PGDOWN.
- Some of the keys on QWERTY base layer are double-duty: they work as usual when tapped, but if held for 200 ms, they work as *Ctrl+key*. These are the keys and the corresponding *Ctrl* functions (work in most apps):
  - **A**: select all
  - **X**: cut
  - **C**: copy
  - **V**: paste
  - **S**: save
  - **Z**: undo
  - **Y**: redo
  - **F**: find
  - **W**: close current tab
  - **T**: open new tab
  - **O**: open file
  - **P**: print
  - **Backspace**: delete a word before cursor (tap to delete a single character before cursor)
  - **Delete**: delete a word after cursor (tap to delete a single character after cursor)
